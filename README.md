# School_District_Analysis
Used Jupyter Notebook to analyze test scores within the school district 
## Analysis 
The purpose of this challenge was to analyze charter and district schools within Py City and compared their reading and math test scores against the school's budget. The school board needed to know which school has had the best test results and how much money is allocated to those schools. Due to possible academic dishonesty at Thomas High School, a second analysis was performed to see the effect on the percentage of reading and math test scores.
